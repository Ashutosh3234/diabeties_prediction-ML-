# PREDICTING-DIABETES-USING-RANDOM-FOREST-CLASSIFIER-AND-DEEP-NEURAL-NETWOK-
DIABETES PREDICTION USING DEEP NEURAL NET AND RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIERS WITH TENSORLOW AND SCIKIT LEARN FRAMEWORK
1.) In this projects Diabets dataset has been imported from Kaggle Machine Learning Repository
2.) With the help of Exploratory Data analysis insights into the datasets have been generated and plots have been made.
3.) All outliers in the dataset were removed and replaced so there is no loss of data.
4.) Three models are used in this :
       i) Random forest classifiers
       ii) Deep Neural networks
       iii) Support vector machine
5.) The best model was choosen and imbalanced data set was converted to balanced dataset using oversampling.
6.) Also locally deployed the web app using streamlit for the model.
PYTHON FRAMEWORKS USED: numpy,matplotlob,seaborn,Scikit learn, Tensorflow.
